            <h2>The idea for this thesis came to me while scrolling through the algorithmic gallery hall of Instagram’s explore section.</h2> 
            <p>I came upon a post depicting a travel destination so idyllic that it was almost uncanny. (see figure.1). Curious, I clicked on the post to examine the captions, comments, and likes. To my surprise this post had hundreds of likes, and scores of people in the comments commending how beautiful the depiction was. I was perplexed, I couldn’t understand why someone would engage and admire such an obviously artificial depiction of a landscape. I questioned if my academic background in new media and photography was casting a jaded gaze upon these photos. Seeking to understand, I started to scan more of the profile and realized that it was a travel-themed account. More precisely, a travel account that curated depictions of travel destinations of a highly artificial and idealized nature. This desire to understand this visual aesthetic, and the admiration people exhibited towards it, led me to continue examining other travel-themed accounts. I found many similar accounts, all curating and depicting the same hyper-idealized depictions of travel. Some of them would use the same depictions between themselves, others didn’t even describe or name the (possibly real) place being depicted. Scanning all these images, I began to slowly understand travel as an ideal, rather than a leisurely activity. What these users in the comments were liking and responding to was the idea of travel, and what travel signifies as a <em>sign.</em></p>

        <div class="content-width">
        <p>While scanning through the travel-oriented accounts, I discerned that these hyper-idealized accounts were not the major influencers within the discursive ecosystem of travel on Instagram. The main accounts were the travel bloggers, who possessed exponentially more followers, from 100,000 to three million followers in count. So if travel was an ideal, then these were the people shaping it. From this point I knew that I would investigate this influence and confounding ideal for my thesis. Though, I could not foresee how far this initial inquiry would take me intellectually. As the thesis was exploratory in scope, it allowed me to iterate my research aims as I gathered more knowledge. What began from the locus of seeking to understand the ideal of travel, expanded to appraising the technology of Instagram as a constructive medium for meaning in society. As the two are related. To understand either, I must strive to understand both.</p> 

        <h2>The turning point of this thesis’s initial research on travel came once I realized how ideologically interwoven it was with the concept and ideal of <em> authenticity. </em> </h2>
        
        <p> As this is what travel bloggers, and other social media influencers in general, utilize to influence their followers minds and pockets (Abidin 2015, Duffy, 2017). The concept of authenticity is highly debated amongst many different scholars and disciplines. Within philosophy, existentialists such as Kierkagard and Nietzsche determined leading an authentic life amounted to rejecting popular ideals in favor of defining one’s own truth (Holt, 2012). From a Frankfurt school perspective, Adorno framed this existentialist pursuit of authenticity in more material terms. As he believed this pursuit was always in relation to social and institutional influences, whether prescribing or diverging from societal ideals they are in some always defining your actions (Adorno 1973). This perspective informs the Banet-Weiser’s (2012) commercial conception of authenticity that this thesis conducted research upon. This conception positions authenticity within our culture of brands as a brand itself (p.11). This intersection between social media, influencers, authenticity, and commercialization has been studied by other scholars within travel and tourist studies (Bozzi, 2016; Van Neuen 2016). As well other other niche platform subcultures, such as aspirational lifestyle content (Hurley, 2019), beauty (Foster, 2022), and video games (Cunningham & Craig, 2017). This thesis contributes to this understanding of commodified authenticity by analyzing the discourse of divergent travel blogger personas. One perspective that projects traditional ideals of travel studied by tourist scholars spanning back to the 1970’s. And an alternative account of travel immersed in luxury and material culture. Cross-analyzing these divergent accounts revealed shared perspectives and discursive strategies in the <em>language of authenticity.</em> </p>

        <p>To investigate the discourse of these travel bloggers within the multimodal structure of Instagram, a theoretical-methodological frame that considers modes, their affordances, and how they construe meaning in social contexts needed to be utilized. Social Semiotics functioned as so. The approaches developed from the theoretical ground of social semiotics are ideal for examining meaning within the structure of Instagram (Aiello et al., 2023). In comparison, to more textually-based discourse analysis methods, social semiotics emphasizes agency people hold as motivated sign-makers. And, further how these motivations are largely defined by implicit institutional power relations (MODE 2012). While this thesis primarily focuses on the written text (captions) and hashtags produced by the travel bloggers, the underlying aim of this investigation is how these texts are constructed as signs within the greater structure of Instagram. As I would come to observe in the pre-analysis of the exploratory phase of this thesis. Travel photography is highly repetitive in aesthetic. I began to observe the photos as mere material evidence of the experience, which thus enabled the travel bloggers to produce authenticity within their written texts. This is another observation explored within my analysis, how the structure of Instagram transforms experience, travel destinations, and people into marketable signs. </p>
        
        <p>This notion liases to the greater point of this thesis. How the technological structure of Instagram and other social media platforms, hegemonically contributes to the construction of societal ideals and discourses. The writings of the late Czech-Brazilian media theorist and philosopher Vilem Flusser, frame much of my thought on how Instagram contributes to our postmodern condition as an <em> apparatus for meaning</em>. But within the interior structure of Instagram, the field of social semiotics contains a growing number of studies examining the process of semiosis within social media platforms as <em>semiotic technologies</em>. I view these philosophical-exterior (Flusser’s apparatus) and methodological-interior (semiotic technology)  views as complementary and attempt to fuse some of their overlaps within my thesis. So, in concordance with my research aims to understand the currency of authenticity held by the travel bloggers, It is my hope that I have provided evidence of the materiality of signs and how they are construed. I consider the critical understanding of this matter to be of great importance for our time, of which often feels mired in absurdism and meaninglessness. </p>
